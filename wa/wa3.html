        The first version of <em>Twin Fantasy</em> was an album recorded solely by Car Seat Headrest's lead singer/songwriter
        Will Toledo, and was released for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want">pay-what-you-want</a> download via Bandcamp on November 2, 2011, while Toledo
        was attending the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary">College of William & Mary</a>. In an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_CityBeat">CityBeat</a>, Toledo explained that due to his
        lack of resources, <em>Twin Fantasy</em> was unable to achieve the expansiveness he originally wanted, adding that,
        "it just never seemed like the book was closed on it".[3] When he first met with independent label Matador Records
        in 2015 before signing, Toledo told them he planned to rerecord the album in full, following the release of the
        compilation album Teens of Style (2015) and the studio album Teens of Denial (2016).[4]
