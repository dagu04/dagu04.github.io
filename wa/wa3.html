        <p><strong><em>Twin Fantasy (Face to Face)</em></strong> is the eleventh studio album by American <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indie_rock">indie rock</a> band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Car_Seat_Headrest">Car Seat Headrest</a>,
        released on February 16, 2018. It is a complete full band <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Re-recording_(music)">re-recording</a> and reworking of the
        band's sixth album, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_Fantasy">Twin Fantasy</a>, by then-solo artist Will Toledo, released on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandcamp">Bandcamp</a> in 2011.

        <p>
        The first version of <em>Twin Fantasy</em> was an album recorded solely by Car Seat Headrest's lead singer/songwriter
        Will Toledo, and was released for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pay_what_you_want">pay-what-you-want</a> download via Bandcamp on November 2, 2011, while Toledo
        was attending the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/College_of_William_%26_Mary">College of William & Mary</a>. In an interview with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnati_CityBeat">CityBeat</a>, Toledo explained that due to his
        lack of resources, <em>Twin Fantasy</em> was unable to achieve the expansiveness he originally wanted, adding that,
        "it just never seemed like the book was closed on it".<sup><a href="#3">[3]</a></sup> When he first met with independent label Matador Records
        in 2015 before signing, Toledo told them he planned to rerecord the album in full, following the release of the
        compilation album <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teens_of_Style">Teens of Style</a></em> (2015) and the studio album <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teens_of_Denial">Teens of Denial</a></em> (2016).<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup>

        Recording for <em>Twin Fantasy (Face to Face)</em> began in 2016, with much
        of the instrumental work being recorded live at Soundhouse in Seattle.
        Vocals were recorded separately by engineer Adam Stilson at Decade
        Music Studios in Chicago. Post production and mixing took place
        between Decade Music Studios and Will Toledo's apartment,<sup><a href="#5">[5]</a><a href="#6">[6]</a></sup>
        with most effects, stems and final mixes run through the studio's
        vintage mixing console. "Stop Smoking (We Love You)" was recorded
        by Toledo in his apartment.<sup><a href="#4">[4]</a></sup></p>
        
        <p>
        On December 13, 2017, the band released a re-recorded version of
        "Beach Life-In-Death" digitally without prior announcement.
        Fans had hopes that the album would be re-recorded and released
        shortly afterwards.<sup><a href="#7">[7]</a></sup> On December 27, 2017, an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_(company)">Amazon</a> listing
        detailing a re-recorded version of Twin Fantasy was found by fans,
        and subsequently uploaded to the Car Seat Headrest <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">subreddit</a>.<sup><a href="#8">[8]</a></sup>
        This was followed up by a listing on SRCVinyl.com with the date
        February 16, 2018,<sup><a href="#9">[9]</a></sup> which contained an abridged version of the
        Matador Records press announcement.<sup><a href="#10">[10]</a></sup></p>

        <p>
        On January 9, 2018, Matador officially announced the release of the 
        re-recording, entitled <em>Twin Fantasy (Face to Face)</em>, alongside a tour 
        announcement and a music video for the single "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_Young_Inhumans">Nervous Young Inhumans</a>".<sup><a href="#11">[11]</a></sup> 
        The album was released via Matador on February 16. The CD release of the album
        included both versions of the album, and a lyric booklet with art by Hojin "Stella" Jung.<sup><a href="#12">[12]</a></sup></p>

        <p>
        The original recording, re-titled to <em>Twin Fantasy (Mirror to Mirror)</em>,
        was released on vinyl as a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Record_Store_Day">Record Store Day</a> on April 21, and
        was re-released to streaming services on November 2.<sup><a href="#13">[13]</a></sup> </p>
